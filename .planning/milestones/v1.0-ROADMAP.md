## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 4.1: UX Polish (inserted after Phase 4 for UAT fixes)

**Key Decisions:**
- Use srcDir: 'src' for cleaner project structure
- Shadow DOM for CSS isolation from YouTube styles
- gifenc over gif.js for ESM support and speed
- Seek-based frame capture for precision
- MM:SS time input format for familiarity
- Draggable modal without overlay for video visibility

**Issues Resolved:**
- WXT CLI interactive init not compatible with non-interactive environment - manually created project structure
- Firefox Developer Edition path differs from standard Firefox - manual extension loading via about:debugging

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
